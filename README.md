# AetheriumCorex64
Middleman Management (Inspired by Libvirt) for Virtual Machines amd64 or x64 on Universal Termux

## Background
This was inspired by me, when searching for AI frontend and GPU Acceleration on Qemu and how to host it and most of them required some full linux capability like docker and stuff and can't run fully on proot, and most of the solution out there aren't exactly aligned with what i want
