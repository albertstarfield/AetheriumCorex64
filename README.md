# AetheriumCorex64
Middleman Management (Inspired by Libvirt) for Virtual Machines amd64 or x64 on Universal Termux

## Background
This was inspired by me, when searching for AI frontend, GPU Acceleration, ZFS support on Qemu on Android non-root (Because banks doesn't allow the user do their own ways or own your device that's might be the reason most of now pulled their support from PC (Either Windows or MacOS)) and how to host it and most of them required some full linux capability like docker and stuff and can't run fully on proot, and most of the solution out there aren't exactly aligned with what i want
